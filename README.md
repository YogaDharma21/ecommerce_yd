# Ecommerce YD

This is an e-commerce website built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Sanity, and Stripe.

## Project Overview

The ecommerce_yd project is a full-stack e-commerce application that allows users to browse and purchase products. The project is split into two main parts:

1. **Next.js Website:** The front-end of the application is built using Next.js, a popular React framework for server-rendered applications. It utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling and Shadcn UI, a set of accessible and customizable React components, for the UI elements.
2. **Sanity Content Studio:** The content management system (CMS) for the e-commerce website is powered by Sanity, a headless CMS that provides a flexible and scalable platform for managing the product data and other content.

The application also integrates with Stripe, a popular payment processing platform, to handle secure online transactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-end**:
  - **Next.js:** A React framework for building server-rendered applications.
  - **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
  - **Shadcn UI:** A set of accessible and customizable React components.
- **Back-end:**
  - **Sanity:** A headless CMS for managing content and data.
  - **Stripe:** A payment processing platform for handling secure online transactions.

## Features

- **Product Catalog:** Users can browse and search for products, view detailed product information, and add items to their shopping cart.
- **Shopping Cart and Checkout:** Users can manage their cart, update quantities, and proceed to checkout to complete their purchase using Stripe.
- **Content Management:** The Sanity Content Studio provides a user-friendly interface for administrators to manage product data, images, and other content.
- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive and mobile-friendly, providing a seamless user experience across different devices.
- **Scalability and Flexibility:** The use of Next.js and Sanity allows the application to scale and adapt to future requirements, making it easier to maintain and extend the functionality over time.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

1. **website:** This directory contains the Next.js application, including the pages, components, styles, and other related files.
2. **sanity:** This directory contains the Sanity project, including the schema definitions, configuration, and other Sanity-specific files.

The separation of the front-end and back-end components allows for better modularity and easier maintenance of the overall project.
